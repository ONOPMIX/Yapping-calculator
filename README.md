# Yapping Calculator

A simple point-based wage calculator written in HTML and JavaScript. Enter your daily earned points, the dollar value per point and your working hours to see your hourly, daily and projected earnings.

You can also serve the file with a local web server:

python3 -m http.server
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## GitHub Pages

To host this calculator online, enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings. Select the `main` branch and the `/` (root) folder. Once enabled, GitHub will provide a link similar to:

```
https://<your-username>.github.io/Yapping-calculator/
```

Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub account name and visit the link to use the calculator.

Every push to the `main` branch will automatically update the page. Share the URL so anyone can access the calculator.
